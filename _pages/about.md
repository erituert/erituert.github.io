I am a Data Scientist committed to driving positive change in society through the use of 🤖 Artificial Intelligence (AI). My interests have driven me to work in the fields of 🔊 Speech Technologies, 🎭 Affective Computing, 🟣 Gender Equality, 🌍 Climate Action and 🧠 Mental Health. My main goal relies on applying AI in a fair, explainable, trustworthy and aligned manner.

I graduated in 2023 with a PhD in Signal Processing Engineering (_Cum Laude_) from [University Carlos III of Madrid (UC3M)](https://www.uc3m.es/home) (Spain ☀️) supervised by [Prof. Carmen Peláez-Moreno](https://scholar.google.es/citations?user=PXEKOr8AAAAJ&hl=en) as part of the 💜 [UC3M4Safety Team](https://www.uc3m.es/ss/Satellite/INST-EstudiosGenero/es/TextoDosColumnas/1371396308527/UC3M4Safety). In UC3M I also coursed a M.Eng. in Multimedia Communications and a B.Eng. in Audiovisual Systems.

As a Postdoctoral Researcher, I've worked in the then Chair of Embedded Intelligence for Health Care and Wellbeing (EIHW) at the University of Augsburg, now [Chair of Health Informatics](https://www.kiinformatik.mri.tum.de/de/lehrstuhle/chair-health-informatics/) at the Technical University of Munich (Germany 🥨) led by [Prof. Björn Schuller](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=TxKNCSoAAAAJ&hl=en), the Groups of [Precision Psychiatry](https://www.lmu-klinikum.de/psychiatrie-und-psychotherapie/forschung-research/working-groups/precision-psychiatry/7ef67d79b4ad4804) of LMU Klinikum and [Max Planck Institute of Psychiatry](https://www.psych.mpg.de/2571270/precision-psychiatry) in Munich, led by [Prof. Dr. Nikolaos Koutsouleris](https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=dPzed4kAAAAJ&hl=de); and in the [Artificial Intelligence in Mental Health (AIM)](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/research/artificial-intelligence-in-mental-health-aim) group in Kings College London (UK 💂).
