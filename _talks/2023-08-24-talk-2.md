![Illustration](/images/interspeech23.png){: .align-right width="200px"} Grateful for having had the opportunity to attend the biggest speech technology event of the year: Interspeech 2023! And for being able to present our joint work with my hard-working colleague [Emma Reyner Fuentes](https://www.linkedin.com/in/emma-reyner-fuentes/) on [predicting the gender-based violence victim condition from speech using machine learning](https://www.isca-archive.org/interspeech_2023/reynerfuentes23_interspeech.html), working together in the [UC3M4Safety](https://www.linkedin.com/company/uc3m4safety/) Team.

I am also delighted to have met amazing people working in (and out) of the field thanks to the conference and its social events. I was gladly surprised by how LGBTIQ+ inclusive and visibilizing the conference is becoming!

And thanks also to Dublin for the wonderful weather we had ;)
