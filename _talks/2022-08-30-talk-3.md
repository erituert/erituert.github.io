![Illustration](/images/wemac.png){: .align-right width="200px"} The team is proud to present the first release of the open access [WEMAC Database](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.00456/). A multimodal women data emotions database captured to help the research on detection of gender-based violence situations. We release this database with the aim of sharing it with the research community, encouraging the improvement of the [baseline results](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9780201) and advancing in the research of multi-modal emotion analysis in general and, in 									gender-based equality, in particular. The code is available [here](https://github.com/BINDI-UC3M/wemac_dataset_signal_processing)!
