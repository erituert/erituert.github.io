![Illustration](/images/thesis_defense_erg.jpg){: .align-right width="200px"} I am equally proud and happy to announce that I defended my Doctoral Thesis with **Cum Laude Distinction**, titled "Multimodal Affective Computing in Wearable Devices with Applications in the Detection of Gender-based Violence". The Committee was composed by [Dr. Elisabeth André](https://www.uni-augsburg.de/de/fakultaet/fai/informatik/prof/hcm/team/andre/), [Dr. Emilia Parada-Cabaleiro](https://www.linkedin.com/in/emilia-parada-cabaleiro-761339121/?originalSubdomain=at) and [Dr. Elena Romero-Perales](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=qI8MpwwAAAAJ&hl=en). I'd like to thank specially my PhD Supervisor for all her support and guidance, [Dr. Carmen Peláez-Moreno](http://www.tsc.uc3m.es/~carmen/Welcome.html).
